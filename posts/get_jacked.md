Sarcopenia is bad news bears, especially for someone with a small bone structure like myself. That means that you want to stack muscle mass before it's too late, and 'too late' is probably somewhere around 40 years old. This doesn't mean that you or I need to be permabulking until age 40, as you can probably gain 90% of your muscular potential with 5 solid years of training. It just means that you need to identify opportune times when they arise so that you get in your 5 years by 40.  

Right now I have plenty of time to train on the weekends and at least one weekday. I have enough money that I can purchase prepared or easily-cooked foods which will taste good enough that I actually eat a lot of them. And I have a membership to a gym with quite a few machines, cables, and free weights. I am the least stressed that I have been during any period in the last 9 years. This will be one of my 5 years. 

Not that it will be straightforward to gain muscle. I have a niggle in my knee that makes squatting and lunging irritating. One of the vertebrae in my back often feels out of place until I pop it, and this makes deadlifting a dubious proposition. If I were a dog taking obedience classes, my owner would describe me as not very food-motivated. These are the constraints I am working with. 

What to do? First, we need to define success: gaining muscle. That is easy enough to measure. But I need something upstream of weight to measure so that I know if my actions are on track, not just my outcomes. That thing will be the number of 'hard' sets I do each week - i.e. sets taken to failure or very near it. 

I have already started my training, with very low volume. A true beginner's level of volume might be 3 sets of 3 different exercises 3 days per week, for a total of 27 sets per week. Arnold may have done around 200 sets per week in his prime. So the range of what the human body can handle is immense. In my first week of training, I performed an exceedingly paltry 23 sets. I expect this number will have to quadruple to gain the 10-15 pounds that I would like. But the nice thing about starting with such low volume is that I can fully recover between workouts, and thereby assess each workout on its own terms. If you enter a workout already fatigued, and the next day you are tired and sore, it's hard to know how much of that effect is from the workout itself and how much is residual from previous workouts. I hope to take advantage of these good experimental conditions by trying out a few new exercises in the coming weeks, hopefully identifying some movements that target particular muscle groups better than my staples. 

I am also starting my training with long rest periods of 4 minutes. I have never rested so long between sets before; I hope this will help me keep intensity high throughout my workouts. Eventually volume will get too high and I will have to reduce them. 

Anyway, the plan is roughly this. Increase volume gradually, preferentially adding it to muscle groups that are no longer getting sore. Assess each workout after it occurs and write down adjustments for next time - to add weight, to look up a different exercise to try, to try adjusting the seat on the machine up or down, etc. Try isometrics for knee-friendly quad work and hammer back extensions like nobody's business for the posterior chain. Have at least 1 scoop of protein powder and a banana before each session, plus the same immediately after. Stock up on pre-made burgers, puffed rice cereal, sweet potatoes, and other foods that I like.  Repeat for many weeks. 

This sounds dumb when written out because it is so simple. So dumb that it might actually work. We will see how it goes.
