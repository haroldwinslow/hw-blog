Many sports need to be removed altogether and delegated to the World Games. All team sports should be out, because an Olympic medal should be the highest honor one can earn in their event, and in team sports it simply isn't. 

Events like shooting which prioritize control over vigor should be out. 

Events which are primarily expressions of one's freedom, finesse, and aesthetic mastery, like surfing, skateboarding, synchronized swimming, diving, trampoline, and gymnastics, should be out.

Highly contrived events like the triple jump and pole vault should be out. Equestrian and sailing should be cut. 

Swims should vary only by distance and water conditions (pool or open water), not by stroke. Freestyle should be totally free, with no restrictions on time or distance spent underwater. Expand open water swimming to include all distances, and choose rough water where possible. Add an "enhanced" set of events where fins and the highly hydrodynamic LZR suits are allowed. 

Cut the triathlon and replace it with two biathlons (land and sea - run + bike and swim + paddle) as well as a quadrathlon (run, bike, swim, paddle). 

Add in more "combat" events in the form of sumo wrestling, arm wrestling, and tug of war. 

Add medleys for running (40m, 200m, 1000m, 5000m), throwing (shot put, discus, javelin, hammer throw), jumping (vertical jump, broad jump, long jump, high jump), carrying (overhead, bear hug, farmerâ€™s walk, yoke walk), lifting (Atlas stone to shoulder height, overhead press, half squat from pins, weighted pulldown), and wrestling (freestyle, sumo, arm, and tug of war). 

Add a new pentathlon consisting of the 1000m run, shot put, long jump, farmer's walk, and Atlas stone to shoulder height.
